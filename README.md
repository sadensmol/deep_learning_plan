# Deep Learning for Beginners

This repository includes all the problems I solved during my learning of DL.

Process is split into parts related to the exact real world problem, and every problem has all the requered resources,
documents and shows the whole learning path from the idea, to the final implementation.

I tried to put as much time as possible to every problem, and provide solutions in both PyTorch and NumPy.

## Environment

 * Visual Studio Code
 * Jupiter Notebooks
 * Python 3
 * Pandas
 * Scikit-Learn
 * Pytorch
 * NumPy 

## Plan

### Movie recommendation system (MRS)  

Download the latest IMDB datasets from : https://datasets.imdbws.com/
and extract them into data/ folder.  

The following Jupiter Notebooks contain different implementations for MRS.  


[Movie Recommendation 1](1.0_movie_recommendation.ipynb)  

Movie recommendation system with content based filtering (CBF) developed with pandas, numpy and scikit-learn libraries.

[Movie Recommendation 2](1.1_movie_recommendation.ipynb)  

Movie recommendation system with CBF deveoped with word2vec algorithm, pandas, numpy libraries.
